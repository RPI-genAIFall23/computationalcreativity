# Computational Creativity
## ECSE 4964/6964, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Fall 2023

*Instructor:* Rich Radke

*Time:* Mondays & Thursdays 4:00 pm - 5:20 pm

*Location:* JEC 4104 

*Course Description:* Creative applications of generative artificial intelligence have exploded in the past year, including image generation tools like Stable Diffusion and DALLE-2 and text generation tools like Chat-GPT3.  This course will survey the theoretical foundations of these tools, focusing on generative models and self-supervised learning, as well as explore the historical and ethical considerations involving the procedural generation of art.  Students will apply cutting-edge tools for generating creative content and critique each otherâ€™s work.

*Prerequisites:* A first course in machine learning (ECSE-4840 or ECSE-4850 or CSCI-4100 or equivalent).  Having taken such a course implies an understanding of calculus, probability, and programming (e.g., the content in MATH-2010, ECSE-2500, and CSCI-1200).  Additionally, a creative/artistic mindset and curiosity/enthusiasm for making fun images and videos is required!

*Staff Contact:* The best way to reach the staff is by posting to the class Discord, or mailing the professor directly at rjradke@ecse.rpi.edu.
